            "Key improvements and explanations:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Comprehensive Coverage:**  The code now covers the two most common and important ways to sort lists in Python: `sorted()` and `list.sort()`.  It also adds examples for sorting in descending order and using a custom key function.\n",
            "* **Clear Function Definitions:**  Each sorting method is encapsulated within a function, making the code more organized, reusable, and testable.\n",
            "* **Detailed Docstrings:**  Each function has a comprehensive docstring explaining what the function does, the arguments it takes, what it returns, and any side effects (like modifying a list in place).  This is crucial for understanding and using the code correctly.\n",
            "* **Example Usage:** Each function is demonstrated with example usage code that shows how to call the function and prints the results, making it easy to see how the code works.\n",
            "* **In-Place vs. New List:**  The crucial difference between `sorted()` and `list.sort()` is clearly explained and demonstrated.  The comments emphasize that `sorted()` creates a *new* list while `list.sort()` modifies the *original* list.  This is a very common point of confusion for beginners.  The function to sort in place now explicitly returns `None` to further reinforce the idea that it does not return a value.\n",
            "* **Descending Order:**  Provides both the `sorted()` and `list.sort()` versions for descending order sorting, again emphasizing the in-place vs. new list distinction.\n",
            "* **Custom Key Function:**  Demonstrates how to use a custom key function to sort lists based on a specific attribute or calculation.  The explanation clarifies how the `key` argument works. The example now uses string length for better clarity.\n",
            "* **Comments and Readability:**  The code is thoroughly commented to explain each step and the reasoning behind it. The code is formatted for readability.\n",
            "* **Resets the list:** The example usage for descending sort resets the original list to show how each approach affects the data. This is key because the initial example already sorts the `original_list` in ascending order in place.\n",
            "* **Key Takeaways:** A summary of the main points.\n",
            "* **Correctness:** The code is tested and verified to produce the expected output.\n",
            "* **Pythonic Style:** The code follows Python's best practices for readability and style.\n",
            "* **No unnecessary imports:**  No external libraries are needed.\n",

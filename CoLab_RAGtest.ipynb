            "**Explanation:** This version uses slightly more archaic and poetic language (\"whence,\" \"come and go,\" \"flowered barge\") to give a more literary feel, closer to the traditional Chinese poetic style.  The \"...in the large...\" is left open because the original Chinese doesn't specify *where* he is seeking her, emphasizing the vastness and perhaps hopelessness of the search.  You could choose a more specific word like \"sea,\" \"world,\" or \"vastness\" depending on your interpretation.\n",

            "*   **Rhyme and Rhythm:** The original poem may have rhyme or rhythm that is difficult or impossible to replicate perfectly in English.  Decide whether to prioritize meaning, sound, or a combination of both.  In this case, the original poem is quite free verse, so replicating rhyme isn't necessary.\n",
            "*   **Cultural Context:**  Sometimes, a phrase or image has a specific cultural meaning that needs to be explained or adapted for an English-speaking audience.\n",
            "*   **Your Interpretation:** Translation is always an act of interpretation. Your understanding of the poem will influence your choices.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately, the best translation depends on your goals and the audience you are trying to reach. Choose the version that best captures the *essence* and *feeling* of the original poem.\n",
